# Singleton Pattern

A single instance of a class is created and shared throughout the application.

- A static member contains the instance of Singleton class, it gets memory only once because of static declaration. 
- Private constructor prevents the instantiation of singleton class from outside the class.
- Static factory method provides global point of access to the Singleton object.
